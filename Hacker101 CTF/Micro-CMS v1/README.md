# Flag [1/4]

## Process

After viewing all of the existing pages on the challenge, I then attempted to append the page id to see if there were any hidden pages. And low and behold, I hit 6 - the forbidden page.

This was without a doubt a flag in my mind, so I knew what to now target. I then continued to create a page, and noticed that pages could be edited.

So, in order to acess the contents of the infamous page 6, I changed the id of my new page to 6 in the ```/edit/x``` portion of the URL and boom - I was able to edit and view the contents of page 6, resulted in a flag.
