Firstly, I tried to inspect the page, since it was pretty empty. I instantly noticed this:

You will see that the only code on the page is:  

```CSS
body {
	background-image: url("background.png");
}
```  

So, after coming to the conclusion that this *.png* file was the only place that could store the flag, I decided to check whats inside of it. So I appended *background.png* to the URL:

And there was the flag!
